**Building a REST API with Spring Boot**

**Introduction**

Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that simplifies the development of web applications. It provides a wide range of features out of the box, making it easy to create RESTful APIs, manage databases, and handle security. In this guide, we will create a simple REST API using Spring Boot.

**Prerequisites**

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
* Maven or Gradle (for project management)
* An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

**Creating a Repository**

1. Create a new repository on GitHub or any other code hosting platform.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-spring-boot-app.git
```

**Setting Up the Development Environment**

1. Open your IDE and create a new project.
2. Select "Spring Initializr" as the project type.
3. Enter the following information:

* Group: com.example
* Artifact: spring-boot-rest-api
* Java Version: 11
* Language: Java
* Dependencies: Web

4. Click "Generate" to download the necessary dependencies.

**Creating the Project Structure**

1. The generated project will have a basic structure with the following directories:

* src/main/java: Contains the Java source code for your application.
* src/main/resources: Contains configuration files and static resources.
* src/test/java: Contains unit tests for your application.

**Writing the Necessary Code**

1. Create a new package in `src/main/java` called `com.example.springbootapi`.
2. Create a new class in the package called `HelloWorldController.java`:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

This class defines a REST controller that handles GET requests to the root URL ("/") and returns a simple "Hello World!" message.

**Running the Project**

1. Open your IDE and run the project as a Spring Boot application.
2. The application will start and listen for requests on port 8080.

**Testing the Application**

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
2. You should see the "Hello World!" message displayed.

**Adding Code to Repository and Pushing to Remote**

1. Add all the changes to your local repository:

```
git add .
```

2. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

```
git commit -m "Added Hello World REST controller"
```

3. Push the changes to your remote repository:

```
git push origin main
```

**Conclusion**

You have now successfully created a simple REST API using Spring Boot. You can further expand the application by adding more controllers, models, and services to handle more complex business logic. Spring Boot provides a powerful framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
