## Building a Currency Converter App with Node.js

### 1. Setting Up the Development Environment

- Install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

- Install a code editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.

- Open a terminal or command prompt.

### 2. Creating the Project Structure

- Create a new directory for your project:

```
mkdir currency-converter
cd currency-converter
```

- Initialize a new Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file:

```
npm init -y
```

- Create a new file called `index.js` for the application code.

### 3. Writing the Necessary Code

- Open the `index.js` file and paste the following code:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const convertCurrency = async (from, to, amount) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/${from}`);
  const rates = response.data.rates;
  const rate = rates[to];
  const convertedAmount = amount * rate;
  return convertedAmount;
};

const main = async () => {
  const fromCurrency = process.argv[2]; // Get the from currency from the command line
  const toCurrency = process.argv[3]; // Get the to currency from the command line
  const amount = Number(process.argv[4]); // Get the amount to convert from the command line
  
  const convertedAmount = await convertCurrency(fromCurrency, toCurrency, amount);
  console.log(`${amount} ${fromCurrency} is equal to ${convertedAmount} ${toCurrency}`);
};

main();
```

- This code uses the 'axios' library to make a GET request to the exchangerate-api.com API to get the latest exchange rates.
- It then converts the given amount from the from currency to the to currency using the retrieved rate.
- The `main` function takes the from currency, to currency, and amount as command-line arguments and calls the `convertCurrency` function to perform the conversion.

### 4. Running the Project

- Run the application by executing the following command:

```
node index.js
```

- Example usage:

```
node index.js USD EUR 100
```

### 5. Testing the Application

- Create a test case using a different set of currencies and amounts.
- Run the application with the test case and verify the output.

### 6. Adding Code to Repository and Pushing to Remote

- Create a new repository on GitHub or any other code hosting platform.
- Add the project files to the repository:

```
git add .
```

- Commit the changes:

```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

- Push the code to the remote repository:

```
git push origin main
```

### Conclusion

You have now created a simple currency converter application using Node.js. This application can be extended to add additional features such as supporting more currencies, handling invalid input, and providing a user interface.
