## Building a Simple Pygame Application

### Introduction

This guide will provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to build a simple game application using the Pygame library for Python. We will cover the basics of Pygame, project structure, coding, and testing, ensuring that even complete beginners can follow along and create their own game.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

**1. Install Python:**

Install the latest version of Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/

**2. Install Pygame:**

Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install pygame
```

**3. Create a Repository (Optional):**

If you are working collaboratively or want to keep your code organized, create a new repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.

### Project Structure

Create a new directory for your game project and organize it as follows:

- **main.py:** The main game script
- **data:** A folder for game assets (images, sounds, etc.)
- **requirements.txt:** A file containing the required Python packages

### Writing the Code

**1. Import Pygame:**

In `main.py`, import the necessary Pygame modules:

```python
import pygame
```

**2. Initialize Pygame:**

Initialize Pygame and set the window dimensions:

```python
pygame.init()
window = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
```

**3. Create a Game Loop:**

The game loop is the core of the game. It continuously updates the game state, draws the screen, and checks for user input:

```python
running = True
while running:
    # Process events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
```

**4. Draw the Scene:**

Inside the game loop, draw the game scene. For example, to draw a circle:

```python
pygame.draw.circle(window, (255, 0, 0), (400, 300), 50)
```

**5. Update the Display:**

After drawing the scene, update the display to show the changes:

```python
pygame.display.update()
```

### Running the Project

**1. Open the Command Prompt:**

Navigate to the project directory in the command prompt or terminal.

**2. Run the Main Script:**

Run the main game script `main.py`:

```
python main.py
```

### Testing the Application

Play the game and check if it runs as expected. Test different user inputs and game scenarios.

### Adding Code to Repository and Pushing to Remote

**1. Add Code to Repository:**

Stage the changes to your code:

```
git add .
```

Commit the changes:

```
git commit -m "Added basic game logic"
```

**2. Push to Remote:**

Push the changes to your remote repository:

```
git push origin main
```

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple Pygame application. This guide has provided you with the basics of Pygame, project structure, coding, and testing. Feel free to explore further and build more complex games as you become more familiar with the library.
