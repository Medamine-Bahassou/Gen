## Building a Simple Pygame Application for Beginners

### Introduction

In this guide, we will embark on a journey to create a basic game using the Pygame library. We will cover everything from setting up the development environment to writing the necessary code and testing our application. Along the way, we will also explore how to add our code to a repository and push it to a remote server.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 or later installed on your system
- Pygame library installed (pip install pygame)
- A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

### Step 1: Creating a Repository

1. Navigate to your preferred version control provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
2. Create a new repository for your project
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://<your-repo-url>.git
```

### Step 2: Creating the Project Structure

1. Inside the cloned repository, create a new directory for your project (e.g., `pygame-game`)
2. Inside the project directory, create the following files:
   - `main.py` (for the main game logic)
   - `settings.py` (for game settings)
   - `assets` (a folder for game assets)

### Step 3: Writing the Code

**main.py**

```python
import pygame
import settings

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((settings.SCREEN_WIDTH, settings.SCREEN_HEIGHT))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Update game logic

    # Render the screen

    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(settings.FPS)

pygame.quit()
```

**settings.py**

```python
# Game settings
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
FPS = 60
```

### Step 4: Running the Project

1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the following command:
```
python main.py
```

### Step 5: Testing the Application

Play the game and observe its behavior. Check if it runs smoothly, responds to user input, and follows the game rules.

### Step 6: Adding Code to Repository and Pushing to Remote

1. Make any necessary changes to the code
2. Stage the changes using the following command:
```
git add .
```
3. Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
```
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```
4. Push the changes to the remote repository:
```
git push origin main
```

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple Pygame application. You have learned the basics of game development using Pygame and gained valuable experience in version control. Feel free to explore further and create more complex games using the knowledge you have gained.
